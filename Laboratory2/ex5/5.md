The client sends a domain name taken from the command line (Ex: www.google.com) to the server. The server opens a TCP connection to the IP address corresponding to the received domain name on port 80 (called HTTP-Srv). It sends on the TCP connection the string: “GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n” and relays the answer back to the client. When HTTP-Srv closes connection to the server, the server closes the connection to the client at its turn.
